# 📘 User Tips Manager (Java)

This Java project is an object-oriented programming (OOP) practice that simulates a system for managing "tips" (advice or recommendations) created by different users. It includes features for tracking metrics such as views, likes, saves, and more.

## 🚀 Main Features
- Create users with associated tips.  
- Query and modify data using getters and setters.  
- Increment metrics (views, likes, saves).  
- Calculate view ratios and average views per day.  
- Classify tips as useful or highly rated.  
- Compare tips by duration or metrics.  
- Adjust thresholds to determine if a tip is well-rated.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **Date Library:** java.util.Calendar  
- **Recommended IDE:** Eclipse or IntelliJ
